## Hardware Needed
1. Raspberry Pi
2. BMP 180
3. I2C Bus if using more than 1 sensors

(**Point to be noted if you are using I2C Pins on rpi the other pins will remain be shown as not available in that case you will have to figure out some sort of solution online.)

## Software
1. Thony Python IDE

## Libraries
1. firebase
2. python-firebase
3. gcloud
4. functools
