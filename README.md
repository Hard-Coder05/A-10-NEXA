## Problem Statement :
Rural as well as Remote residents encounter barriers to healthcare that limit their ability to obtain the medical services they need. The problem of monitoring such a large number of patients has always been a challenging task for the Medical System of India. 

Also in current scenario, Highly transmittable diseases like COVID-19 have forced people to avail home hospitalization and treatment, hence treating everyone in need of immediate monitoring is difficult in this pandemic. 

May it be a pandemic or the problem of distance, Consulting a good doctor is a great and urgent issue that needs to be dealt with as soon as possible. Also, the need for proper management of a patient's historical record and tracking of current conditions is one the challenges in front of the Medical System in India.

Keeping in mind the above problems, A solution needs to be proposed that solves the problems efficiently and is economically sustainable for the poor citizens of the society.

## Why this issue?
India has a significant shortage of trained physicians nationwide when compared to the WHO recommended ratio. Additionally, with about 80 percent of the medical workforce concentrated in top 8-10 cities and serving only 28 percent of the total population, access to healthcare still remains an aspiration for many. In rural India, a patient may have to travel even about 122 kms to meet a doctor. The need of the hour is to provide good quality healthcare access to the rural and remote population as well.

## Objectives :
- To connect patients in remote and rural areas with the best doctors of their choice.
- To provide essential medical services at lowest possible cost.
- To provide proper patient medical history management system.
- To provide proper patient monitoring equipments in remote areas, where medical reach is hard or disconnected due to lack of connectivity.
